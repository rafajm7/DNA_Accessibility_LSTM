Description: This package, given a .BAM file with the genome of a mouse before creating an insult through injection,
             and another .BAM one hour after the injection, extracts the DNA of different regions of its genome,
             concretely promoters, 3' UTRs and 5' UTRs, and builds a dataframe for each type of region relating them to the change 
             in the ATAC-Seq of their nearest gene before and after the injection.
